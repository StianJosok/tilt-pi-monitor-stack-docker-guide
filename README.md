# README - Tilt Pi Monitor Stack Docker Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up a monitoring stack using Docker, InfluxDB, Telegraf, and Grafana to track data from a Tilt Hydrometer. It provides step-by-step instructions for creating a complete data monitoring and visualization pipeline.

## Prerequisites
- A Raspberry Pi running a **64-bit OS** (I have tested with 3b+ but not lower spec)
- A functioning Tilt Hydrometer with a functioning UI
    - [Install Tilt Pi on Raspbian Bookworm](https://tilthydrometer.com/blogs/news/install-tilt-pi-on-raspbian-buster-compatible-with-all-rpi-models-including-rpi-4) (for a clean or existing Raspberry Pi installation).
    - [Set Up Tilt Pi (Pre-installed Image)](https://tilthydrometer.com/blogs/news/how-to-set-up-tilt-pi-part-1) (for using a pre-installed image).

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank [the creators](https://tilthydrometer.com/pages/about-us) of the **Tilt Hydrometer** for creating such a great product and for the support theyâ€™ve offered throughout this project. Their customer service and community-focused approach has been great. They have helped me with some details and been quick to respond. Their engagement has fueled me to make my own setup better and given me the opportunity to give back to the community of homebrewers and homelabbers.

## Plans for the Future

- Dockerize the Node-RED aspect of the Tilt Pi.
- Dockerize the aioblescan to allow capturing data directly from the Tilt Hydrometer.
