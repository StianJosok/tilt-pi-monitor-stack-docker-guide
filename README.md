## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank [the creators](https://tilthydrometer.com/pages/about-us) of the **Tilt Hydrometer** for creating such a great product and for the support theyâ€™ve offered throughout this project. Their customer service and community-focused approach has been great. They have helped me with some details and been quick to respond. Their engagement has fueled me to make my own setup better and given me the opportunity to give back to the community of homebrewers and homelabbers.

## Plans for the Future

- Dockerize the Node-RED aspect of the Tilt Pi.
- Dockerize the aioblescan to allow capturing data directly from the Tilt Hydrometer.
